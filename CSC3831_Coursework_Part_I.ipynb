Not to mention, only 234 of those were mutual. This probably means that I extracted a fair bit more than I needed too.\n","\n","Let's break down each of median_house_value's correlations and their meaning:\n","\n","* Median income: Both in manual outlier detection and in LOF we ended up with a stronger correlation between median_house_value and median_income than we started with in the houses dataset, and in all cases it is a strong correlation. This makes sense, richer people buy more expensive houses.\n","\n","* Rooms per household: Though not as strong in LOF as it was in manual detection, rooms_per_household has a decent positive correlation with median_house_value. Again this makes sense, bigger house -> more expensive.\n","\n","* Total rooms / Total bedrooms / Population: As I mentioned previously, any correlation with these features is irrelevant, as different areas have a different number of households, therefore these features were normalised.\n","\n","* Housing median age: Neither the original dataset, the manually cleansed dataset or the LOF-cleansed dataset discovered a correlation between house value and age, and no such correlation was found in the geographic distribution visualisation either.\n","\n","* Households: We used this feature to normalise other features in order to find correlations.\n","\n","* People per household: A fairly strong negative correlation was found between house value and people per household both by manual detection and LOF. This could indicate that rich people in California tend to have smaller families.\n","\n","* Bedrooms per household: My manual detection and LOF disagree here. I have found a decent negative correlation between house value and bedrooms per household, which would back up the correlation with people per household, LOF found no correlation.\n","\n","* Longitude / Latitude: Location is an important determining factor of house value, as it became evident when visualising the geographic distribution of the areas. The areas near the coast had the highest median house values, but since it is not a clear east/west or north/south divide, we cannot see it in the numbers."],"metadata":{"id":"dYQK-0-fdair"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Data Imputation and Machine Learning"],"metadata":{"id":"ivmiyNu8b0Ts"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##
