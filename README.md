# CSC3831 Coursework

This work was done as part of the CSC3831 Predictive Analytics Computer Vision & AI module at Newcastle University and is split into three parts.

#### Part 1
Uses the California Housing set to perform data analysis, outlier detection, data imputation and median house value prediction.

#### Part 2
Fine tuning and comparing the performance of four different machine learning algorithms in predicting median house value in the California Housing set.

#### Part 3
Uses a version of the CIFAR-10 dataset (CIFAIR-10). Different CNN structures are trained in classifying the dataset's images and then compared.
